# 3DSHaxe
basicly lets you make 3ds homebrew using the haxe programming language!

# to setup:

install devkitpro  
install haxe  
install Reflaxe.cpp  
(do so by running `haxelib git reflaxe.cpp https://github.com/RobertBorghese/reflaxe.CPP nightly`)  
(yes you need nightly!!)  

# to compile

run the build.bat  
(if you want to do a clean build, run cleanbuild.bat, it basicly just deletes the export folder then runs build.bat)
